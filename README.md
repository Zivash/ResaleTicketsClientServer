# Marketplace System for Buyers and Sellers

## Project Overview

This project implements a marketplace system for buyers and sellers using a client-server architecture. The server handles requests from clients (buyers and sellers), and the clients interact with the server to perform actions such as browsing listings, making purchases, and posting tickets. The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and socket programming for communication between clients and the server. Additionally, a string matching algorithm is used to optimize ticket listings for buyers, improving the system's efficiency. Unit and integration tests are also included to ensure the reliability and functionality of the system.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture:**  
  The system is designed with a client-server model. Clients (buyers and sellers) communicate with the central server to exchange data, such as ticket listings and purchase actions.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  The system is structured using OOP principles, which helps maintain modular and organized code.

- **Socket Programming:**  
  Socket programming enables communication between clients and the server. The server listens for incoming client connections, while clients connect and interact with the server in real-time.

- **String Matching Algorithm:**  
  A string matching algorithm is implemented to efficiently match buyer requests with available ticket listings, improving search functionality and system performance.

- **Unit and Integration Testing:**  
  The system includes unit and integration tests to verify that individual components and the overall system are functioning correctly.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Socket Programming** (Java Sockets)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP)
- **JUnit** (for testing)
